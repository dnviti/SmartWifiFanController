## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into SmartWifiFanController itself.

### Reporting Bugs

-   **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/dnviti/SmartWifiFanController/issues).
-   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/dnviti/SmartWifiFanController/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements
